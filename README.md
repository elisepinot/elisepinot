### 👋 Hello there! I'm Elise!

I am currently navigating a transformative journey from a background in sales and business functions to the dynamic world of web development. 
Enthusiastically enrolled in the JavaScript React Developer program at OpenClassrooms, I am sharpening my skills and gearing up for an exciting career transition.

### 💻 What I'm learning:

- 📱Implement a responsive layout with HTML5 and CSS3.
- 👓 Ensure the accessibility of a website.
- 🌐 Create dynamic web applications with Javascript, React and APIs.
- ⌗ Ensure data quality in a web application through testing.
- 📚 Contribute to a code project using agile methodology...
- 🚀... And much more!

👩🏻‍🎓 I completed the JavaScript React Developer training with OpenClassrooms from February 2023 to May 2024, and I hold a Software Developer (RNCP Level 6) diploma. Now, I’m ready for a new professional challenge where I can apply the technical skills I’ve acquired. 😃

### 👩🏻‍💻 My projects

At OpenClassrooms, learning is project-driven which is really great as  I think it is the fastest way to become proficient!
Projects offer hands-on experience so I can hit the ground running when I start working as a web developer.

The JavaScript React Developer path has a series of projects that I need to complete one at a time with the support of my mentor (30 minutes each week). 
I receive a detailed brief with the context, customer requirements and additional details. 
Then it’s up to me to go and make it real!

### 🎯 Career Aspirations

I am thrilled to embark on a new chapter, blending my extensive background in sales, particularly within the dynamic landscape of SaaS, with my newfound passion for web development. Having spent 3.5 years in the tech industry as a Customer Success Manager, I bring a unique blend of soft skills cultivated in client-facing roles.

In my previous professional experiences, I honed skills such as effective communication, problem-solving, and a customer-centric approach. Now, as I transition to the development side, I am excited to merge these soft skills with the technical prowess gained through my current program at OpenClassrooms.

I am eager to contribute to a forward-thinking team that values both my prior experience and my fresh perspective as I step into the world of creating with code. 

I look forward to not only adapting my skill set but also actively shaping and innovating in this dynamic field.
